"""PyInstaller entry point for the curatarr standalone binary.

Packaged via `pyinstaller curatarr.spec` (see docs/BINARIES.md and
RELEASING.md). With no arguments, this just calls the same
web.app.main() that run-ui.sh / run-ui.ps1 already use for a source
install, so the binary and the source-install web UI stay identical in
behavior. All UI logic lives in web/app.py - keep it that way rather
than adding anything here.

`from web.app import main` is deferred to inside _launch_web_ui(),
reached only by the no-flag launch path below, rather than imported at
module level - a CLI/cron-only source install (requirements.txt, no
requirements-ui.txt - see that file's header) never has flask
installed, and every other flag (--help/-h, --version,
--run-recommender, --self-update, --self-update-worker) needs to
keep working without it.

Where a packaged binary reads/writes config/cache/logs: see
utils.helpers.get_project_root() - when running frozen (this file,
built by PyInstaller), that resolves to a per-user data directory
instead of a repo checkout, since a downloaded binary has no repo
checkout to anchor to.

Windowed (no-console) launch on Windows
------------------------------------------------------------------
curatarr.spec builds the Windows exe with console=False, so
double-clicking it never flashes a console window - see
_configure_windowed_launch()/_attach_or_setup_console() below for how
that interacts with CLI use (`curatarr.exe --run-recommender ...` from
an existing cmd/PowerShell), --debug/CURATARR_DEBUG=1, and file
logging. macOS/Linux builds are unaffected (console=True there,
unchanged).

Dispatcher mode - what makes the web UI's Run button work in a frozen
binary
------------------------------------------------------------------
The web UI normally triggers a run by shelling out to
`sys.executable recommenders/<x>.py [user]` (see web/job_runner.py).
That file doesn't exist next to a packaged onefile exe - there is no
`recommenders/` directory on disk once everything is bundled into the
binary, and `sys.executable` for a frozen process IS the curatarr exe
itself, not a python.exe that could run an arbitrary .py path anyway.

So when frozen, web/job_runner.py instead re-invokes this exe as:

    curatarr --run-recommender <engine> [user]

and THIS file recognizes that flag and runs the requested recommender
module's own main() in-process - but "in-process" here means inside
that fresh, short-lived subprocess the web UI just spawned, never
inside the long-lived Flask server process itself. That distinction is
what keeps this safe: the recommender entry points hijack sys.stdout
and call sys.exit() (see web/app.py's module docstring for why that's
unsafe inside the server), which is exactly fine for a process whose
only job is to run one recommender and exit - the same contract as the
`python3 recommenders/<x>.py` invocation this replaces for a source
install. That subprocess already gets its stdout/stderr piped back to
the server via web/job_runner.py's Popen(stdout=PIPE) call, so it never
runs _configure_windowed_launch() below - only the primary UI launch
does.

Self-update dispatch (v2.8.29) - the same trick, for two more flags
------------------------------------------------------------------
`--self-update-worker <--pid P --host H --port PORT>`: the DETACHED
worker web/update_apply.py's UpdateManager spawns for the web UI's
"Update now" button when frozen (see that module's docstring for why
it can't just re-invoke `sys.executable
os.path.abspath(update_apply.py)` the way a source install does - there
is no separate Python interpreter and no on-disk update_apply.py next
to a onefile exe). Recognized here for exactly the same underlying
reason `--run-recommender` is: it's the only way anything can hand a
frozen exe "run this specific internal entry point instead of the
normal UI launch" on the command line.

`--self-update`: the user-facing CLI flag (docs/BINARIES.md) - download,
verify, and swap the binary in place, then exit. Not a hidden dispatch
flag like the two above (it's meant to be run directly by a user/
script), but lives in the same `if len(sys.argv) > 1` chain since it's
the same "frozen-only alternate entry point" shape.
