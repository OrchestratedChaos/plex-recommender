# Project version - single source of truth
__version__ = "2.23.0"

# Cache version - bump this when cache format changes to auto-invalidate old caches
CACHE_VERSION = 9  # v9: new cache FIELD - `content_rating` per item
# (recommenders/movie.py/tv.py _process_item), used by calibration to hold
# a collection to the profile's certificate mix and not just its genre mix.
# Unlike v6-v8 this is a genuine format change: without a rebuild the field
# is simply absent and certificate calibration silently no-ops.
#
# v8: SCORING change - corpus IDF (utils/corpus_idf.py)
# now discounts genre/keyword matches by how ubiquitous the term is across
# the library. Same reasoning as v7/v6 below: per-item scores are cached
# against profile_hash, which captures the user's profile but NOT the
# scoring code, so without this bump every existing install would keep
# serving scores computed by the pre-IDF algorithm and the change would be
# invisible until each user's profile happened to shift.
#
# v7: another SCORING change, not a format one - the
# MAX_REDISTRIBUTION_MULTIPLIER cap below (2.10.90). Same reasoning as v6
# immediately after this: a scoring change that doesn't move this constant
# is invisible on every existing install.
#
# v6: NOT a format change - a SCORING change (2.10.85's
# per-item weight-redistribution fix, see CHANGELOG). Cached per-item scores
# are keyed on profile_hash alone (recommenders/base.py's cache-hit branch in
# get_recommendations()), which captures the user's watch profile but NOT the
# scoring code that produced the number. So a scoring fix is a silent no-op on
# every existing install - every item is a cache hit against a score computed
# by the OLD algorithm - until that user's profile happens to change. Confirmed
# empirically while shipping 2.10.85: the fix changed nothing on a real install
# until this constant moved. Any future change to how scores are CALCULATED
# needs this bump too, not just changes to what the cache stores.
#
# v5: Added rating/vote_count to TV show cache entries so
# tv: quality_filters (min_rating/min_vote_count) actually apply - they were
# previously silently a no-op for TV (see CHANGELOG). Bumping this forces a
# one-time full rebuild of BOTH the movie and show caches on next run (this
# constant isn't tracked per-media-type) - existing cache files are deleted
# and every item is re-fetched from TMDB from scratch, so no show is ever
# left with a half-populated/missing rating that would be misread as 0 and
# wrongly filtered out.

# attached to Frequency and Skyscraper while the live-action R.I.P.D.
# carries `animation`, and genuine children's films often carry no kid
# genre at all. By certificate the same split is clean: G 90% / PG 51%
# kid-tagged against 1% for both PG-13 and R.
#
# Weighted equally: genre still drives what kind of story surfaces, the
# certificate stops a collection drifting to content aimed at a different
# audience than the profile watches.
# Smallest profile a calibration target may be built from.
#
# Calibration reproduces whatever distribution it is handed, faithfully.
# The catastrophic case is a target derived from a couple of titles: one
# user had two watched shows, both TV-G, and calibrating that would have
# driven their whole collection to ~100% TV-G.
#
# 10 rather than a larger number, because the cost of blocking a usable
# target is real and was measured: a user with 21 certificate samples had
# certificate calibration disabled by an earlier threshold of 25, which
# regressed their collection from 14% to 22% G/PG against a 9% profile.

#
# Measured on a real library: a title with no tmdb_keywords, against a

# ahead of every title that actually matched on several dimensions.

#
# The bug class this exists to kill: a key that is spelled plausibly, sits
# at a plausible depth, parses as valid YAML, and is then silently never
# read - so the setting is simply inert and the operator has no signal at
# all. That is exactly how `movies:`/`tv:` `quality_filters` and
# `randomize_recommendations` stayed non-functional through several
# releases (see CHANGELOG 2.10.23 and this module's
# resolve_media_type_overrides docstring). The resolution paths themselves
# were consolidated and fixed then; this is the other half of #316 - the
# standing warning so the next such key can't go quiet.
#
# Deliberately warn-only, never fatal: an unknown key is far more likely
# to be a typo or a leftover from an older release than something worth
# refusing to start over, and failing closed here would turn a cosmetic
# config wart into an outage on an unattended scheduled run.
# =============================================================================

# from config/*.example.yml plus a sweep of real root-level reads in the
# codebase - see TestKnownRootConfigKeysCoverThePublishedExamples, which
# fails if an example file grows a section that isn't listed here.
#

    This is THE single resolution path for these keys - it replaces two
    formerly-independent implementations that had quietly drifted apart
    (see CHANGELOG 2.10.23/2.10.37/2.10.39 and this module's git history):
    `recommenders/base.py`'s own inline `self.media_config` resolution
    (LIVE - this is what every install's actual recommendations used),
    and this module's now-deleted `adapt_config_for_media_type()` (DEAD -
    computed a plausible-looking, differently-defaulted result that
    nothing in the recommendation-generation path ever read). Consolidated
    here so a future new `movies:`/`tv:` key only needs wiring up once,
    with a standing test (see tests/test_config.py's
    TestResolveMediaTypeOverridesKeyEnumeration) asserting every key
    documented in config/tuning.example.yml actually resolves.

    Mutates and returns `config` in place (matching load_config()'s own
    `_load_module_configs()` merge convention) with these additional/
    overwritten top-level keys: `limit_results`, `randomize_recommendations`,
    `normalize_counters`, `show_summary`, `show_genres`, `show_cast`,
    `show_language`, `show_rating`, `show_imdb_link`, `weights`, and
    (movies only) `show_director`.

    Every other root-level section (`plex`, `tmdb`, `users`, `plex_users`,
    `collections`, `recency_decay`, `rating_multipliers`, `general`,
    `cache_dir`, `libraries`, `negative_signals`, `radarr`, `sonarr`,
    `quality_filters`, and anything else) passes through completely
    untouched, because `config` itself (not a cherry-picked
    reconstruction of it) is what gets returned - there is no way for
    this function to silently drop a root-level key the way the old
    `adapt_config_for_media_type()` dropped `plex_users` (see CHANGELOG).

    Deliberately NOT resolved here (left exactly where they already
    correctly, non-divergently live):
      - `quality_filters` (`min_rating`/`min_vote_count`): still resolved
        by `BaseRecommender.get_recommendations()` at call time, straight
        from `self.media_config`/`self.config` - that was always the one
        correct, live implementation (the old dead path's 5.0/50 movies
        default never matched it - see CHANGELOG for which one won).
      - Per-field weight *defaults* (`director` vs `studio`, and their
        values): still resolved by `PlexMovieRecommender`/
        `PlexTVRecommender._load_weights()` - already the single,
        non-divergent source once the dead path is gone. Only the
        `movies:`/`tv:` -> legacy-root-level `weights:` fallback *chain*
        is centralized here (that part WAS duplicated, and divergently -
        the old dead path never checked the legacy root-level tier).
