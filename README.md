# Curatarr

**Personalized recommendations for your Plex library. Simple setup. Powerful results.**

Turn your Plex server into a smart recommendation engine. Analyze what you and your users watch, then surface the hidden gems already in your library—plus discover what to add next.

![Curatarr dashboard](docs/img/dashboard.png)

---

## Why This Exists

Your Plex library has thousands of titles. Your users have watched maybe 10% of them. The problem isn't content—it's discovery.

**Curatarr solves this by:**
- Analyzing each user's watch history
- Scoring unwatched content by similarity (keywords, genres, cast, directors)
- Creating personalized collections that update automatically
- Generating external watchlists so you know what to acquire next

## Download

Grab the binary for your platform - no Python, no `git clone`:

| Platform | Asset |
|---|---|
| Windows x64 | `curatarr-windows-x86_64.exe` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `curatarr-macos-arm64` |
| Linux x64 | `curatarr-linux-x86_64` |
| Linux arm64 | `curatarr-linux-arm64` |

macOS binaries are Apple Silicon only - Intel Mac users should run from
source (see [Quick Start](#quick-start) below). Linux binaries need
glibc 2.28+ (Debian 12+, Ubuntu 22.04+, RHEL/Rocky/AlmaLinux 9+ - check
yours with `ldd --version`); older distros should also run from source.
Details in [docs/BINARIES.md](docs/BINARIES.md).

[Latest release](https://github.com/OrchestratedChaos/curatarr/releases/latest) · full platform-specific steps and checksums in [docs/BINARIES.md](docs/BINARIES.md)

Run it (macOS/Linux: `chmod +x` the downloaded file first - see
[docs/BINARIES.md](docs/BINARIES.md) for the exact per-OS steps) and it
opens the dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:8787` in your browser - no
Python install, no terminal required.

First run, your OS will warn about an unsigned binary - Windows SmartScreen: **More info → Run anyway**; macOS Gatekeeper: right-click → **Open** (a plain double-click on a fresh download won't offer that option - it has to be right-click the first time). Details in [docs/BINARIES.md](docs/BINARIES.md#unsigned-binaries).

**First-time setup:** there's no separate wizard - the dashboard opens with nothing configured yet ("No users configured"). Use the top nav's **Connections** screen to add your Plex/TMDB/etc. details, then **Users** to add your Plex users, then **Settings** for scoring and scheduling. See [Web UI](#web-ui-beta) below for what each screen does.

Binaries self-update: the app notifies you (CLI and web UI banner) when a newer release exists, and the web UI's **Update now** button (or `curatarr --self-update` from a terminal) downloads it, cryptographically verifies it (signed checksum + hash match - see [docs/BINARIES.md](docs/BINARIES.md#self-updating)), and swaps itself in place. No manual download required, but nothing applies automatically without you clicking/running one of those - for that, use a [source install](#quick-start) and set `general.update_mode: force`.

## Features

### For Your Library (What to Watch)
- **Per-user recommendations** — Each user gets their own curated collection
- **Per-user by default** — Each user's library Browse/Search only shows their own recommendation collection, not others' (UI-level separation, not access control — see FAQ)
- **Smart scoring** — Weights keywords, genres, cast, and directors
- **Franchise order** — Started a series? You get your next unwatched entry: *Rocky* watched gets you *Rocky II*. Never touched it? The mid-series entry is dropped rather than promoted, so the collection never fills with originals for series you've shown no interest in (`movies.franchise_order`, overridable per user)
- **Recency bias** — Recent watches influence recommendations more
- **Rewatch detection** — Content you love gets weighted higher
- **Genre exclusions** — Skip horror for the kids, documentaries for movie night
- **Auto-updating collections** — `🎬 John - Recommendation` appears in Plex (customizable naming template — `collections.movie_name_template`/`tv_name_template` in tuning.yml)

### For Acquisition (What to Get)
- **External watchlists** — Content NOT in your library that users would love
- **Sequel Huntarr** — Find missing movies from collections you've started (complete that trilogy!)
- **Horizon Huntarr** — Track upcoming unreleased movies from franchises you own
- **Streaming service grouping** — "Available on Netflix" vs "Need to acquire"
- **Sonarr/Radarr integration** — Push recommendations directly for download
- **Trakt/Simkl/MDBList export** — Sync to tracking services and list managers
- **Auto-cleanup** — Items removed when they appear in your library
- **Genre balancing** — Matches user viewing habits proportionally

### For You (Simple & Robust)
- **One file, no install** — download the binary and run it; `./run.sh` handles everything from source
- **Multi-library support** — Each Plex library gets its own Sonarr/Radarr root folder, quality profile, tags, monitor/search, and optionally its own *arr instance; recommendations run per-library so Movies, TV, Anime, and Kids each follow their own rules
- **Modular config** — Main settings plus optional integration files
- **Update notifications** — Notifies (CLI + dismissible web UI banner) when a newer signed release exists, for every `update_mode` including `off`; set `update_mode: force` to auto-apply on each run instead
- **Smart caching** — Auto-clears incompatible caches after updates
- **Auto-scheduling** — Optional daily run: the built-in in-app scheduler (Settings screen, no cron needed) or host cron/Task Scheduler
- **Clean logs** — Know exactly what happened

---

## Quick Start

Prefer a no-Python, no-Docker download instead? See [Download](#download)
above - that's the easiest path for most people. The options below cover
Docker and running from a source checkout (Python required for the
latter - also the path if you're developing or contributing, though
fully supported for regular use too, with its own auto-update).

### Docker
No Python install needed - runs the same web UI as the
[standalone binary](#download), packaged as a container image instead.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OrchestratedChaos/curatarr.git
cd curatarr
./setup.sh              # Interactive setup wizard (recommended)
```

Or manually configure instead of the wizard:
```bash
cp config/config.example.yml config/config.yml
# Edit config/config.yml with your details
```

**Before starting it**, set `CURATARR_AUTH_TOKEN` in `docker-compose.yml`
(uncomment the line and set it to e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`) - the
container always binds `0.0.0.0` internally regardless of the host port
mapping, so it refuses to start without one. Then:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:8787` and log in at `/login` with the token you
set. No build required - `docker-compose.yml` pulls the published
multi-arch (amd64/arm64) image from GHCR. See
[docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md) for volumes, authentication, scheduling
recommendation runs, and updating.

### macOS / Linux (from source)
Requires Python 3.10+ (`python3 --version`). `run.sh` checks this up front and
tells you clearly if it isn't met - it won't leave a half-updated install.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OrchestratedChaos/curatarr.git
cd curatarr
./run.sh    # Setup wizard runs on first launch
```

### Windows (PowerShell, from source)
Requires Python 3.10+ (`python --version`). `run.ps1` checks this up front and
tells you clearly if it isn't met - it won't leave a half-updated install.
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/OrchestratedChaos/curatarr.git
cd curatarr
.\run.ps1   # Setup wizard runs on first launch
```

Below the Python floor, or don't want to manage a Python install at all? Use
the [standalone binary](#download) instead - it bundles its own Python and
UI deps, so it's unaffected by this.

First run takes 5-10 minutes to analyze your library. After that, it's fast.

---

## Web UI (beta)

A local dashboard for running recommendations and checking status without the terminal:

```bash
./run-ui.sh     # macOS/Linux
.\run-ui.ps1   # Windows (PowerShell)
```

Or skip the source install entirely and grab a [standalone binary](#download)
- it opens straight to this same UI.

Opens `http://127.0.0.1:8787` in your browser once the server is ready (binds to
localhost only). From there you can see each user's last-run status, trigger a
run (full pipeline, or just movie/tv/external) with a live streaming log, and
browse generated watchlists and past logs.

**Config screens** let you set up curatarr entirely from the browser instead of
hand-editing YAML:

- **Connections** (`/config/connections`) - Plex, TMDB, Tautulli, Sonarr, Radarr,
  and Trakt, each with a Test Connection button. (Simkl and MDBList are
  YAML-only for now - `config/simkl.yml` / `config/mdblist.yml` - not yet on
  this screen.)
- **Users** (`/config/users`) - add/remove Plex users and per-user preferences
  (display name, excluded genres, max content rating, streaming services).
  A "Fetch from Plex" button pulls the real account/Home/friend user list
  instead of typing names by hand, and can be re-run any time Plex users change.
- **Settings** (`/config/settings`) - scoring weights, quality filters, recency
  decay, rating multipliers, negative signals, external recommendation limits,
  a **Scheduling** section (enable the in-app scheduler - a daily time, optional
  weekday restriction - as an alternative to host cron/Task Scheduler; see
  [Scheduling](#scheduling) below), and the Sonarr/Radarr/Trakt auto-sync
  safety toggles (surfaced with a warning - turning auto-sync on starts
  writing to your download clients on every run).
- **Libraries** (`/config/libraries`) - manage multiple Plex libraries, each
  with its own Sonarr/Radarr root folder, quality profile, tags, monitor/search
  behavior, and optionally its own *arr instance. Same "Fetch from Plex" button
  as Users, for library sections.

Secrets (tokens/API keys) are never shown once saved - fields show a
"configured" / "not set" status, and you only need to enter a new value to
change one. Saves are validated (e.g. scoring weights must sum to 1.0) and
written atomically, so a bad submission can't corrupt your config files.

## Observability

Local-first only - nothing here ever leaves your machine or gets shipped to a
third-party service.

### Structured logging

Set `logging.format: json` in `config/config.yml` (default is `text`, the
existing colored console output - nothing changes unless you opt in) for
JSON-lines log output instead: one JSON object per line with `timestamp`,
`level`, `logger`, `message`, plus any structured fields a given log call
attaches (e.g. `user`, `engine`, `duration`). Convenient for feeding logs into
`jq`, Loki, or another log aggregator. Secrets are redacted the same way
either format - a leaked Plex/Sonarr/Radarr/etc. token is masked in JSON
output exactly as it already is in the human-readable one.

### `/metrics` (Prometheus)

The web UI exposes Prometheus text-format metrics at `/metrics`:
recommender run count/duration by engine and outcome, outbound API request
count/latency/error count by service (Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, TMDB, Trakt,
Simkl, MDBList, Tautulli, Curacast), local cache hit/miss, self-update attempts/
failures, unhandled error count, and a `curatarr_build_info` gauge carrying
the running version. Rendered directly from a small local state file - no
new runtime dependency, and scraping never makes a network call or triggers
a Plex/TMDB request.

**Same auth as everything else**: for a native install (bound to
`127.0.0.1` only) `/metrics` needs no token, same as every other route. For
Docker (bound `0.0.0.0` - see [docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md#authentication))
it requires the exact same `CURATARR_AUTH_TOKEN` as the rest of the app -
`/metrics` labels expose library names, user counts, and which integrations
are configured, which isn't public data any more than the config screens
are. Only `/login` and `/healthz` are ever unauthenticated.

Example Prometheus scrape config:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: curatarr
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["curatarr-host:8787"]
    authorization:
      credentials: "YOUR_CURATARR_AUTH_TOKEN"   # omit entirely for a loopback-only native install
```

### `/healthz` and `/status.json`

`/healthz` stays unauthenticated and deliberately minimal - liveness plus
version, nothing else - so it's safe to leave open to a container
orchestrator's health check with no token. Richer readiness detail (last run
time/outcome, whether `config.yml` currently loads, whether a run is in
progress) lives instead on the authenticated `/status.json`, which - like
`/metrics` - needs a token on a non-loopback bind.

## What You Get

### In Plex
Collections automatically appear:
```
🎬 John - Recommendation       (50 movies)
🎬 Sarah - Recommendation      (50 movies)
📺 John - Recommendation       (20 shows)
📺 Sarah - Recommendation      (20 shows)
```

Pin them to your home screen. They update daily.

### External Watchlists
Interactive HTML file with export buttons:
```
recommendations/external/watchlist.html

- All users combined in one interface
- Select which movies/shows to export
- Click "Export to Radarr/Sonarr" → downloads IMDB IDs
- Grouped by streaming service availability
- Auto-opens in browser after run (configurable)
```

Also generates per-user markdown for reference:
```
recommendations/external/john_watchlist.md
recommendations/external/sarah_watchlist.md
```

---

## Configuration

### Minimal Config
```yaml
plex:
  url: http://your-plex-server:32400
  token: YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN
  movie_library: Movies
  tv_library: TV Shows

tmdb:
  api_key: YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY

users:
  list: john, sarah, kids
```

**Get your keys:**
- [TMDB API Key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) (free account required)
- [Plex Token](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/)

### Environment Variables

For Docker or CI environments, you can use environment variables instead of storing secrets in config.yml/sonarr.yml/radarr.yml/trakt.yml/simkl.yml/mdblist.yml. This is a convenience for operators using Docker secrets or an orchestrator's own secrets management - not a replacement for one; Curatarr itself still doesn't encrypt anything at rest.

| Variable | Overrides |
|----------|-----------|
| `PLEX_URL` | `plex.url` |
| `PLEX_TOKEN` | `plex.token` |
| `TMDB_API_KEY` | `tmdb.api_key` |
| `TAUTULLI_API_KEY` | `tautulli.api_key` |
| `CURACAST_API_KEY` | `curacast.api_key` |
| `SONARR_API_KEY` | `sonarr.api_key` |
| `RADARR_API_KEY` | `radarr.api_key` |
| `TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET` | `trakt.client_secret` |
| `TRAKT_ACCESS_TOKEN` | `trakt.access_token` |
| `TRAKT_REFRESH_TOKEN` | `trakt.refresh_token` |
| `SIMKL_CLIENT_ID` | `simkl.client_id` |
| `SIMKL_ACCESS_TOKEN` | `simkl.access_token` |
| `MDBLIST_API_KEY` | `mdblist.api_key` |

Environment variables take precedence over config file values, and the web UI's Connections screen correctly shows a field as "configured" when it's set only via the environment (never the value itself - only ever a masked status).

### Per-User Preferences
```yaml
users:
  list: john, sarah, kids
  preferences:
    john:
      display_name: John
      # Adds to (never replaces) the top-level streaming_services list -
      # same merge behavior as exclude_genres above.
      streaming_services: [netflix, hulu, disney_plus]
    sarah:
      display_name: Sarah
      exclude_genres: [horror]
      franchise_order: false  # Overrides movies.franchise_order for Sarah only
    kids:
      display_name: Kids
      exclude_genres: [horror, thriller, war]
      max_rating: PG  # Only G and PG content (movies: G < PG < PG-13 < R < NC-17)
```

**Franchise Order:** `franchise_order` is per-person because the setting describes a *person*, not a library — a completionist who wants walking through Rocky I–VI and a housemate who just wants tonight's best match are both right, and they share one server. Unset means follow `movies.franchise_order` in tuning.yml.

**Content Rating Filter:**
- Movies: `G`, `PG`, `PG-13`, `R`, `NC-17` (from least to most restrictive)
- TV: `TV-Y`, `TV-Y7`, `TV-G`, `TV-PG`, `TV-14`, `TV-MA` (from least to most restrictive)
- Recommendations above the user's `max_rating` are filtered out

### Multi-Library Setup (Optional)

By default Curatarr uses the single `plex.movie_library` / `plex.tv_library`
pair above. To manage multiple Plex libraries separately (e.g. Movies + Kids
Movies, or TV Shows + Anime) - each with its own Sonarr/Radarr routing - add
a `libraries:` block to `config/config.yml` instead:

```yaml
libraries:
  - id: movies                       # stable slug; auto-derived from name if omitted
    name: Movies
    section: Movies                  # Plex section title
    media_type: movie                # movie | tv
    arr:                             # optional; each field falls back to the global sonarr.yml/radarr.yml
      root_folder: /data/movies
      quality_profile: HD-1080p
      tag: Curatarr
      monitor: false
      search: false
      minimum_availability: released # movie-only
    instance:                        # optional; routes this library to its own *arr instance
      url: http://localhost:7878
      api_key: YOUR_RADARR_API_KEY
  - id: tv-shows
    name: TV Shows
    section: TV Shows
    media_type: tv
    arr:
      root_folder: /data/tv
      quality_profile: HD-1080p
      series_type: standard          # tv-only
```

Each library is scanned and scored independently. `arr:` sets the
root folder/quality profile/tag/monitor/search/availability/series-type for
that library - any field left out falls back to the matching global
`radarr.yml`/`sonarr.yml` setting for that media type. `instance:` is
separate and optional: it points the library at its own Radarr/Sonarr
server instead of the default one in `radarr.yml`/`sonarr.yml`, for setups
where (say) Anime routes to a different Radarr than Movies. Manage all of
this from the browser instead at `/config/libraries` (see
[Web UI](#web-ui-beta)).

**Already using `plex.movie_library`/`plex.tv_library`?** Nothing to change -
Curatarr auto-synthesizes those into a single-entry `libraries:` list at
load time, so existing configs keep working unchanged.

### Tautulli Integration (Optional)

Supplements Plex's own watch history with history from Tautulli - mainly
useful for shared/external users whose Plex-native history retention is
thin.

```yaml
# In config/config.yml
tautulli:
  enabled: true
  url: http://YOUR_TAUTULLI_URL:8181
  api_key: YOUR_TAUTULLI_API_KEY   # Settings -> Web Interface -> API Key
```

Users are matched to Plex accounts by email (falls back to username).
Disabled by default; if Tautulli is unreachable or a user can't be matched,
Curatarr silently falls back to Plex-only history.

### Curacast Integration (Optional)

curacast (a sibling product) plays a Plex library back through simulated live TV channels and
marks watched items via Plex's own `/:/scrobble` endpoint - that bumps
`viewCount` but never creates a `/status/sessions/history/all` row, so
live-TV viewing is otherwise invisible to Curatarr's watch-history-based
profile. This pulls curacast's own graded watch-credit feed instead,
weighted by tier (`sampled`/`tasted`/`partial`/`substantial`/`complete`)
and recency, the same way Plex/Tautulli history is - but never a star
rating or rewatch multiplier, since a live-TV credit carries neither. A
credit at or above `exclude_at_weight` (default 0.8 - "substantial", i.e.
70%+ of the program seen, the completion bar Netflix used for its own
"viewer" definition before 2019) also marks that item as watched for
recommendation exclusion, exactly like real Plex/Tautulli history does -
so a movie or show binged on live TV stops being recommended back. A
credit below that (`partial`/`tasted`/`sampled`) never excludes; they
bailed early and the item stays recommendable.

```yaml
# In config/config.yml
curacast:
  enabled: true
  url: http://localhost:8000
  api_key: YOUR_CURACAST_API_KEY
  min_weight: 0.4          # Ignore credits below this weight (0.4 = "partial" and up)
  exclude_at_weight: 0.8   # Credits at/above this weight also count as "already watched" for recommendation exclusion
  username: ""             # Optional: restrict to one curacast viewer; blank = the configured Plex user
```

Disabled by default; if curacast is unreachable, misconfigured, or a credit's
`program_key` no longer resolves in the Plex library, Curatarr silently
falls back to Plex-only history for that item/run.

### General Settings
```yaml
general:
  plex_only: true              # Only recommend from Plex library
  update_mode: notify          # notify (default) | force | off - see below
  log_retention_days: 7        # Keep logs for 7 days

logging:
  verbosity: quiet              # off | quiet (default) | verbose - see below
  format: text                  # text (default) | json - see Observability below
```

`logging.verbosity` controls how much gets logged: `quiet` (default) -
run start/completion/failure per engine and user, scheduled-run
confirmations, unhandled errors, and any external API (Plex/TMDB/
Tautulli/Curacast/Sonarr/Radarr/Trakt/Simkl/MDBList) failure; `verbose` - all of
that plus per-item filtering decisions, discovery iterations, and cache
hits; `off` - errors only. Also overridable via the `CURATARR_LOG_LEVEL`
environment variable for a one-off troubleshooting run. An explicit
`logging.level` (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, or `ERROR`) is still read
as a legacy override if set and takes precedence over `verbosity` -
only needed for `WARNING`, the one standard level with no
verbosity-tier equivalent.

`general.update_mode` controls how Curatarr handles new releases:
- `notify` (default) — CLI prints a one-line notice and the web UI shows a
  dismissible banner when a newer release exists; nothing is applied
  automatically. Source installs (`run.sh`/`run.ps1`) additionally prompt
  `Update available: vX. Update now? [y/N]` on each interactive run. The web
  UI banner's **Update now** button works for both install types: source
  installs verify and apply the same signed release used by `run.sh`/
  `run.ps1`; binaries download, cryptographically verify (signed checksum +
  hash match - see [docs/BINARIES.md](docs/BINARIES.md#self-updating)), and
  swap themselves in place. Either way it reconnects automatically once the
  server restarts. Binaries can also self-update from the command line:
  `curatarr --self-update`.
- `force` — source installs (`run.sh`/`run.ps1`) auto-apply verified signed
  releases from GitHub on each run, no prompt (the old `auto_update: true`
  behavior). Binaries never auto-apply anything regardless of this setting -
  `force` on a binary install just behaves like `notify` (banner + CLI
  notice only; use the **Update now** button or `--self-update` to apply).
- `off` — same CLI notice and web UI banner as `notify` above: `off` never
  means "don't tell me", only "don't ask me and don't apply automatically"
  (an opted-out install silently missing every update forever was
  considered a bug, not a feature). The one thing `off` actually disables is
  `run.sh`/`run.ps1`'s interactive `Update available: vX. Update now? [y/N]`
  prompt on launch (source installs only) - the dismissible banner, its
  **Update now** button, and the CLI notice all still work exactly like
  `notify`.

Either way, the web UI banner's dismiss button (**×**) doesn't hide a
version forever - it snoozes that specific version for 7 days, after which
it's shown again if you're still on it. A release newer than the one you
dismissed is never held back by an existing snooze; it shows immediately.

`general.auto_update` (legacy) is still read as a fallback if `update_mode`
isn't set: `true` behaves like `force`, `false` behaves like `off`. Existing
configs keep working unchanged; new installs get `update_mode: notify`.

### Tuning (Optional)
```yaml
movies:
  limit_results: 50           # Recommendations per user (the final
                              # collection count - see general.limit_plex_results
                              # below for the internal scoring buffer)
  franchise_order: true       # Recommend the earliest UNWATCHED entry of a
                              # series instead of whichever sequel scored
                              # highest; each series takes one slot
  quality_filters:
    min_rating: 5.0           # TMDB rating threshold
    min_vote_count: 50        # Minimum votes

  days_91_180: 0.50           # 3-6 months: 50%

collections:
  stale_removal_days: 7       # Rotate unwatched Plex collection labels

general:
  limit_plex_results: 100     # Advanced: candidate-scoring buffer per run
                              # (defaults to 2x limit_results; rarely needs changing)

external_recommendations:
  min_relevance_score: 0.65   # See note below
  auto_open_html: false       # Open HTML watchlist in browser after run
```

### Trakt Integration (Optional)

  plex_users: [your_username]
```

**Setup:** In the web UI (binary, Docker, or source), use the
**Connections** screen - no file editing needed. From a source checkout
you can instead run `./run.sh` and follow Step 6, or hand-write
`config/trakt.yml`.

### Sonarr Integration (Optional)

Push your external TV recommendations directly to Sonarr:

```yaml
# config/sonarr.yml
enabled: true
url: http://localhost:8989
api_key: YOUR_SONARR_API_KEY

# Sync behavior
auto_sync: true             # Auto-add when external recs finish
user_mode: mapping          # mapping, per_user, or combined
plex_users: [john]          # Which users to sync (for mapping mode)

# Import settings
root_folder: /tv            # Where to store shows
quality_profile: HD-1080p   # Quality profile name
tag: Curatarr               # Tag for easy cleanup

# Safe defaults (shows just get added, no downloads)
monitor: false              # Don't monitor for new episodes
search_missing: false       # Don't search for episodes
```

**Setup:** In the web UI (binary, Docker, or source), use the
**Connections** screen. From a source checkout you can instead run
`./run.sh` and follow Step 7, or hand-write `config/sonarr.yml`.

**User modes:**
- `mapping` — Only sync users listed in `plex_users`
- `per_user` — Sync all users separately
- `combined` — Merge everyone's recommendations

### Radarr Integration (Optional)

Push your external movie recommendations directly to Radarr:

```yaml
# config/radarr.yml
enabled: true
url: http://localhost:7878
api_key: YOUR_RADARR_API_KEY

# Sync behavior
auto_sync: true             # Auto-add when external recs finish
user_mode: mapping          # mapping, per_user, or combined
plex_users: [john]          # Which users to sync (for mapping mode)

# Import settings
root_folder: /movies        # Where to store movies
quality_profile: HD-1080p   # Quality profile name
tag: Curatarr               # Tag for easy cleanup

# Safe defaults (movies just get added, no downloads)
monitor: false              # Don't monitor for downloads
search_for_movie: false     # Don't search for movie
```

**Setup:** In the web UI (binary, Docker, or source), use the
**Connections** screen. From a source checkout you can instead run
`./run.sh` and follow Step 8, or hand-write `config/radarr.yml`.

### MDBList Integration (Optional)

YAML-only for now - not yet in the [Connections UI](#web-ui-beta). Export
recommendations to MDBList for use with Kometa/PMM and other tools:

```yaml
# config/mdblist.yml
enabled: true
api_key: YOUR_MDBLIST_API_KEY

# Sync behavior
auto_sync: true             # Auto-export when external recs finish
user_mode: mapping          # mapping, per_user, or combined
plex_users: [john]          # Which users to sync (for mapping mode)

# List settings
list_prefix: Curatarr       # Lists named "Curatarr Movies", "Curatarr TV"
replace_existing: true      # Clear list before adding (vs. append)
```

**Setup:** This one has no Connections screen yet, so it's a hand-written
file either way: `config/mdblist.yml` in a source checkout, or
`mdblist.yml` inside your data directory for a binary install
(`~/.curatarr`, or `%APPDATA%\curatarr` on Windows - see
[docs/BINARIES.md](docs/BINARIES.md#where-data-lives)). From source you
can also run `./run.sh` and follow Step 9.

**Tip:** MDBList exports work great with [Agregarr](https://agregarr.org) for Plex collection placeholders. See the [wiki](https://github.com/OrchestratedChaos/curatarr/wiki/Agregarr-Integration) for setup instructions.

### Simkl Integration (Optional)

YAML-only for now - not yet in the [Connections UI](#web-ui-beta). Full
integration with Simkl for anime/TV/movie tracking with excellent anime database:

```yaml
# config/simkl.yml
enabled: true
client_id: YOUR_SIMKL_CLIENT_ID
access_token: (filled by setup wizard)

# Import watch history (great for anime from Crunchyroll, etc.)
import:
  enabled: true
  include_anime: true

# Discovery from Simkl trending/popular
discovery:
  enabled: true
  anime_focus: true        # Prioritize anime discovery

# Export recommendations to Simkl watchlist
export:
  enabled: true
  auto_sync: true
  user_mode: mapping
  plex_users: [your_username]
```

**Setup:** Like MDBList above, no Connections screen yet - hand-write
`config/simkl.yml` in a source checkout, or `simkl.yml` in your data
directory for a binary install (`~/.curatarr`, or `%APPDATA%\curatarr` on
Windows). From source you can also run `./run.sh` and follow Step 10.

### Huntarr: Collection Movie Finder

Huntarr scans your Plex library for movies that belong to collections (trilogies, franchises, etc.) and helps you track what's missing and what's coming.

```yaml
# In config/config.yml
huntarr:
  sequel_huntarr: true    # Find missing movies from collections you've started
  horizon_huntarr: true   # Track upcoming unreleased movies from collections you own
```

**Sequel Huntarr** — Missing collection movies:
- Scans all movies in your library for TMDB collection IDs
- Shows collection name and how many you own (e.g., "2/3")
- Displays streaming availability for missing movies
- Only includes released movies (no placeholders)

**Horizon Huntarr** — Upcoming releases:
- Finds unreleased movies from franchises you own
- Shows production status (Post Production, In Production, Planned, Rumored)
- Displays expected release date (or TBA)
- Perfect for tracking that next Marvel or Star Wars film

**Both features appear as separate tabs in the HTML watchlist, centered below user tabs.**

**Command-line flag:**
- `--huntarr-only` — Run only Huntarr features, skip recommendations.
  Source install: `./run.sh --huntarr-only`. Binary: the flag passes
  through the packaged entrypoint as
  `curatarr --run-recommender external --huntarr-only`, or just use the
  web UI's **External** run button.

**Caching:** Collection data cached for 7 days. IMDB IDs cached permanently. Cache auto-invalidates when your library changes.

### External Recommendations: Relevance Score

The `min_relevance_score` setting (0.0-1.0) controls how strictly personal the external watchlist recommendations are:

- **Score** = How many of your watched items recommend this title (normalized 0-100%)
- **Rating** = TMDB audience rating (used only as tiebreaker)

**How it works:**
1. Items above the threshold are prioritized (sorted by personal relevance)
2. Lower-scored items only appear if not enough high-relevance items exist
3. This ensures you get personally relevant content, not just popular movies

**Tuning:**
- `0.65` (default) — Balanced. Most users should start here.
- `0.50` — Looser. More variety, less strictly personalized.
- `0.25` — Much looser. Maximum variety, least personalized.

If you're seeing too many "random" recommendations, increase this value.

---

## How It Works

1. **Fetch watch history** — Pulls each user's watched content from Plex
2. **Build preference profile** — Counts genres, directors, actors, keywords watched
3. **Score unwatched content** — Calculates similarity to user's taste
4. **Apply filters** — Excludes genres, enforces quality thresholds
5. **Create collections** — Labels content in Plex, collections auto-populate
6. **Generate watchlists** — External recommendations grouped by streaming service

### Similarity Scoring
```
Score = (keyword_match × 0.50) +    # Most specific signal - themes, topics
        (genre_match × 0.25) +       # Baseline preference
        (actor_match × 0.20) +       # Cast preferences
        (director_match × 0.05)      # Style indicator (most don't pick by director)
```

**Scoring uses sum with diminishing returns** — Multiple weak matches add up rather than averaging down. A movie with 15 matching keywords scores well even if each individual match is partial.

Weighted by recency (recent watches count more), user ratings (5-star content counts more), and rewatch count (loved content counts more).

**Weight redistribution:** If a movie's component has no matches (e.g., unknown director), that weight redistributes proportionally to components that did match—so you still get meaningful scores.

## Scheduling

Two ways to get recurring runs - pick one. Running both means two
separate runs at two different times, each unaware of the other.

### Option A: the in-app scheduler (no cron needed)

Enable it on the web UI's **Settings** screen (see [Web UI](#web-ui-beta)
above): set a daily time and, optionally, restrict it to specific
weekdays. Runs the full pipeline (movie, tv, external) from inside the
same long-running process - no host cron, no scheduled task - and works
the same way for a source install, Docker, or a downloaded binary. Off
by default. If the scheduled time arrives mid-run, that occurrence is
skipped and logged, never queued; a missed occurrence (app was down at
the scheduled time) is never made up later - only the next real
occurrence fires.

### Option B: host cron / Task Scheduler

Source installs' first run also prompts to set this up. Or add manually:

#### macOS / Linux (cron)
```bash
# Daily at 3 AM - source install
0 3 * * * cd /path/to/curatarr && ./run.sh >> logs/daily-run.log 2>&1

# Daily at 3 AM - binary install (no checkout to cd into; logs land in
# ~/.curatarr/logs regardless)
0 3 * * * /path/to/curatarr-linux-x86_64 --run-recommender full
```
Most binary users won't need this at all - the built-in scheduler on the
Settings screen covers it without touching cron.

#### Windows (Task Scheduler)
The PowerShell script offers to create a scheduled task automatically. Or manually:
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task → "Curatarr"
3. Trigger: Daily at 3:00 AM
4. Action: Start a program
   - Program: `powershell.exe`
   - Arguments: `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\curatarr\run.ps1"`

#### Docker (cron on host)
```bash
# Daily at 3 AM
0 3 * * * cd /path/to/curatarr && docker compose run --rm curatarr-recommend >> logs/daily-run.log 2>&1
```
See [docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md#scheduling-recommendation-runs) for details.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need Plex Pass?**
No. Works with free Plex.

**Q: Will this modify my media files?**
No. Only adds labels to Plex metadata.

**Q: How many watched items needed?**
At least 5 for meaningful recommendations.

**Q: Can users see each other's recommendations?**
When browsing or searching the library, no — by default each user's recommendation collection is excluded from every other user's view (Plex label restrictions), and the admin/server owner always sees all of them (Plex limitation). This is UI-level separation, not an access-control boundary: Plex enforces the exclusion on the collection object, not on the items inside it, so a user who already has (or guesses — ratingKeys are small sequential integers) a collection's ratingKey can still retrieve its contents directly through the Plex API. Disable with `private_collections: false` in tuning.yml if you want shared visibility instead.

**Q: What about new users with no history?**
They're skipped until they have enough watch history.

## Troubleshooting

### macOS / Linux
```bash
# Check logs
tail -100 logs/daily-run.log

# Run with debug output (source install)
./run.sh --debug

# Binary install: same flag, and logs go to ~/.curatarr/logs/curatarr.log
./curatarr-macos-arm64 --debug

# Verify config
python3 -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('config/config.yml')))"
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Check logs
Get-Content logs/daily-run.log -Tail 100

# Run with debug output
.\run.ps1 -Debug

# Verify config
python -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('config/config.yml')))"
```

**Common issues:**
- TMDB API key invalid → Get free key from themoviedb.org
- Plex connection failed → Check URL and token
- A user can see another user's private collection, or their own is hidden from them → likely a `PrivateCollection_*` label / exclude-filter mismatch; run `python scripts/diagnose_private_labels.py` (read-only) from the project root to compare labels actually on collections against the exclude filters actually stored on each account
- No recommendations → User needs more watch history
- "Cache outdated" message → Normal after updates, rebuilds automatically
- Want to stop `run.sh`/`run.ps1`'s interactive "Update now? [y/N]" prompt on launch → Set `general.update_mode: off` in config/config.yml (the dismissible CLI/web notices still appear either way - see `general.update_mode` above)
- Want updates auto-applied instead of just notified → Set `general.update_mode: force`
- Want a specific update's notice to stop appearing for a while → Click the **×** on the web UI banner (snoozes that version for 7 days)

### Docker
See [docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md#troubleshooting) for the full Docker
troubleshooting guide (logs, healthcheck, permissions, LAN/reverse-proxy
access). Docker installs update via `docker pull` - see
[Updating](docs/DOCKER.md#updating) - not `git pull` or the web UI's
"Update now" button, neither of which apply inside a container.

**Manual update for a source install (if update_mode is `off` or `notify`):**
```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

## Development

### Running Tests

The real recipe is [.github/workflows/tests.yml](.github/workflows/tests.yml)
(what actually runs on every push/PR); the short version:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock -r requirements-ui.lock -r requirements-docker.lock
pip install pytest pytest-cov pip-audit

pytest tests/ -v --tb=short --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=85
```

Lint/format (also CI-enforced - `ruff format --check` blocks merges,
`ruff check`/`mypy` are advisory-only for now):

```bash
pip install ruff mypy
ruff format --check .
ruff check .
mypy .
```

## Credits

Inspired by [netplexflix's](https://github.com/netplexflix) Movie/TV Recommendations for Plex. This project takes the core concept of TMDB-based similarity scoring and rebuilds it with:

- Clean modular architecture
- Multi-user support with per-user preferences
- External watchlists with streaming service grouping
- Automated collection management
- Integration ecosystem (Trakt, Simkl, Sonarr, Radarr, MDBList)
